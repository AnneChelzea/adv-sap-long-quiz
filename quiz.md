## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
-Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages.

For example, multiple business processes in an organization require the user authentication functionality. Instead of rewriting the authentication code for all business processes, you can create a single authentication service and reuse it for all applications.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-Standardized service contract- The specification helps the consumer use the service. It is essential to allow service consumers access to these specifications. 
-Loose coupling - It can operate independently of each other and it promotes flexibility and maintainability because it also says that changes to one servoce should not affect others.
-Abstraction - in this characteristic abstraction breaks dependencies and introduces agility.
-Reusability - from the word itself Reusability it can be cheap or expensive but developers or users can reduce development time and the associated support cost.
-Autonomy - This doesn't need also any dependencies an must stand on their own , Helps also to track the use of a service. But need to watch them for performance and usability.
-Statelessness- A service deals with moments in time. It has no memory. If a client asks for data the service responds but does not keep track or store any data.
-Discoverability- A service needs to be discoverable by a user in order to facilitate reuse. To encourage faster usage of the service, the system should provide as much information as possible and instruct the user on how to interact with it properly. 
-Composability- it enable your organization to combine packaged business capabilities to define business processes. And it provie solid support for composing services and achieving business goals. and allows the consumers to encounter business capabilities as services that can be stitched together to build more complex business processes.

3. Define Microservices.
 base on my research it is made up of very small and completely independent software components, called microservices, that was specialize and focus on one task only. it best suited also to a modern cloud computing environments.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Microservices are independently scalable , fast , portable. And platform agnostic characteristics native to the cloud. They are also known as decoupled, which means they have limited to no dependencies on other microservices. they also have the local access to all data they need, this creates data duplication which microservices make up for in performance and agility.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
 Microservices architecture is an evolution of the SOA architectural style. they are the same when it comes to styles of aiming or aim to create flexible, scalable, and modular systems. While also they share some common principles. on the other hand the differences in terms of the organizational impacts.

6. Define Web Services.
base on my research it is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network. And use to many organizations use multiple software systems for management(s).

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
- Interoperability
-Loose Coupling
-Reusability
-Platform independence
-Standardized Communication
-Servcie discoverability
-Scalability
-Security 
-statelessness
-Cost-Efficiency
It provides several benefits , it contributes of flexbility, interoperable, and distributed systems to the development.the adoption of web services brings numerous advantages, ranging from improved interoperability and loose coupling to reusability, security, and cost-efficiency. These benefits make web services a foundational component of modern software architectures, facilitating the development of scalable and adaptable systems.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
-Service Description
-Platform Independence
-Statelessness
-Service Discoverability
-Scalability
-Security
 These characteristics contribute to the flexibility, interoperability, and modularity of web services. These make the services a powerful and widely adopted technology for building interoperable and distributed systems in various domains. And it contributes to the success of Web services in facilitating seamless communication and itegration across diverse applications and platfroms.
9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
-Service Provider
-Service Requester
-Service Registry 
It has 3 operations and the 3 interactions is consists of Publish , Find and Bind.
10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
-SOAP ( Simple Object Access Protocol)
-UDDI ( Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)
-WSDL ( Web Services Description Language)
This 3 are the known Web services Components that communicates over the world, services the provides a standard means of interoperating between software applications running on a variety of platforms and frameworks. It has a great services because of its functions that was created to have a better use Web services and much more.
